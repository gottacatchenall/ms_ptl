**What is this paper?**

The goal of this paper is to introduce PTL to a broad audience, extend
the framework from being specific to latent representation of networks
[@Strydom2022FooWeb; @Strydom2022GraEmb] to arbitrary traits, and
provide guidelines for when PTL is appropriate and how to validate its
prediction using both simulated and empirical data

# What is Phylogenetic Transfer Learning

The goal of PTL is to take a species pool for which a given trait is
only *partially* observed, and inpute the value of that trait for the
rest of the species based on the evolutionary relatedness of each
species.

## Ancestral State Reconstruction

*Ancestral State Reconstruction* (ASR; also called ancestral character
reconstruction, character estimation, or character mapping) is a core
topic in phylogenetics [@Joy2016AncRec]. The goal is, given an estimate
of a phylogeny $\mathcal{P}$ and trait values $T_i$ for each extant
species in the phylogeny $i$, to estimate the value of that trait at
some historical point in the phylogeny (typically at the node
representing the MRCA of a clade of interest).

To do this, one assumes a statistical model of evolution (and often
tries to infer the best among a set of candidate models). Depending on
whether the trait of interest is discrete or continuous, the models are
typically discrete-space Markov chains (where the transition matrix is a
target of inference) or, in the continuous setting, either Brownian
Motion or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process (where the parameters of
the model are the target of inference). The former is models neutral
evolution and the latter is used when there is hypothesized selection on
the trait.

The methodology used to fit models has followed the historical
progression from maximum parsimony models (a naive approach that favors
as few evolutionary changes as possible in discrete traits) to maximum
likelihood estimation. Modern methods revolve on using Bayesian methods,
which has the direct benefit of including uncertainty estimates in
infered ancestral states, and potentially uncertainty in the true
topology of the phelogeny itself [@Huelsenbeck2001EmpHie].

Typically rate of trait evolution is learned as a single value across
the whole phylogeny, and branch length enables 'amount' of evolution.
Although in principle a hierarchical\* model could be used to infer both
a global rate of evolution and rate values specific to each branch
(\*sadly 'hierarchical' in this is sense different than 'hierarchical'
as it is used in @Huelsenbeck2001EmpHie, which refers to different tree
models but a single set of parameters across all branches---this is
because these models are constructed in the context of DNA substition
rates, which are assumed to be fixed).

## Phylogenetic Transfer Learning

The core goal of Phylogenetic Transfer Learning (PTL) is to take a
phylogeny $\mathcal{P}$ where the species pool consists of two types of
species: (1) species with trait observations, which we denote
$\mathcal{O}$ and call the *observed* species and (2) species *without*
trait observatoins, which we denote $\mathcal{U}$ and call *unobserved*,
and produce predicted trait values for the unobserved species
$\mathcal{U}$.

PTL does this by using ASR to infer a parameterized model of evolution
and ancestral state of the partially observed trait, and then to
simulate the parameterized evolutionary model forward from the ancestral
node to get an estimate of trait values (with uncertainty) for each
species in $U$.

The *transfer learning* component in particular comes from the first use
of this methods to inpute latent representations of species based on
their position in food-webs [@Strydom2022FooWeb; @Strydom2022GraEmb],
although the method if flexible enough to be applied to either latent or
observed traits.

There are two possible models for PTL to be done in: (1) As in
[@Strydom2022FooWeb], the the evolutionary model is inferred only from
the observed trait values $O$. (2) The evolutionary model from a trait
for which there are observations available for the entire species pool.
It may be the case that evolutionary dynamics inferred with auxillary
available information for every species (e.g. the raw sequences from
which the tree is built) could improve imputation accuracy.

# Substance of the paper

The main substance of this paper is to provide guidelines on when PTL is
robust, and diagnostics to validate PTL estimates. This will be done in
two parts: **(1)** using simulated phylogenies and trait values to
compare efficacy of PTL imputation across known "ground-truth"
evolutionary dynamics, and **(2)** using published ASR datasets, with
known values for all extant species, to test imputation efficacy
empirically.

## Simulated phylogenies

First goal is to test predictive efficacy of PTL under various
parameterizations of the "ground-truth" evolutionary dynamics, e.g. -
Rate of speciation - Rate of evolution - Trait dimensionality &
correlation - Frequency of "puntuactions" (i.e. pertubations to trait
value at a speciation event)

and second to compare efficacy based on different properties of the
data, e.g. - Proportion of species with trait values - Predictive
efficacy vs. distance to MRCA w/ data - Is there a set of traits for all
species to infer evolutionary dynaimcs? - How correlated are evolution
between traits for all species vs. traits we want to impute

## Real data

Thankfully there are lots of ACR studies out there with data for each
extant species. So, in short, find as many ACR studies as we can, and do
crossvalidation where we drop the trait values for \~20% of the species
and inpute them with PTL, and compare.

## Questions to address

-   What phylogenetic scales can PTL give robust predictions?
    -   There is a clear upper limit (if the MRCA for set of species is
        too long ago, there will be massive variance in predicted state
        at the tip)
    -   There is also a lower limit (if there is
        horizontal-gene-transfer and the phylogeny is not a reliable
        proxy for how traits are evolving)
    -   Robustness to noise in trait measurements?
    -   How does this very w/ amount and different types of selection
-   When is PTL overkill?
    -   Weighted average of neighbors by distance as alternative (ack.
        David Rolnick for idea)
-   What diagnostics can we use to be confident a PTL inputated trait is
    statistically robust?

# Possible Applications

The core idea of PTL is to fill in gaps for data-sparse processes in
ecology, so naturally the applications are going to be focused.

**Link prediction in networks**

This is the inciting question for which the idea was
conceived[@Strydom2022FooWeb]. Interactions are hard to sample
[@Catchen202MisLin]. Not much to say here that isn't in
[@Strydom2022GraEmb].

**Forecasting species range shifts**

Many projections of species range shifts under climate change are based
on statistical associations between historical species observations and
climatic conditions. The gap between so-called correlative
vs. mechanistic species distribution models [@Shabani2016ComAbs] is of
critical interest for forecasting species ranges, but robust mechanistic
understandings about what and why climatic conditions limit where a
species' range require detailed sampling and potentially experimental
conditions [@Lee-Yaw2016SynTra], which are difficult to scale. PTL could
potentially alleviate this by giving good proxies of the physiological
limitations of species ranges for more species.

**Connectivity and movement ecology**

Reliable information about species movement is sparse, and PTL could
fill this gap [@Catchen2023ImpEco].

**Model species and ecological monitoring**

There are a lot of species on Earth. Monitoring them all would be hard.
Can we use single species a proxies for larger groups of species? Maybe
a little. PTL can guide us on what good proxy species are.
