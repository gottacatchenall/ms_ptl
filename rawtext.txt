# What is Phylogenetic Transfer Learning

## Ancestral State Reconstruction

*Ancestral State Reconstruction* (ASR; also called ancestral character
reconstruction, character estimation, or character mapping) is a core
topic in phylogenetics [@Joy2016AncRec].

The goal is, given an estimate of a phylogeny $\mathcal{P}$ and trait
values $T_i$ for each extant species in the phylogeny $i$, to estimate
the value of that trait at some historical point in the phylogeny
(typically at the node representing the MRCA of a clade of interest).

To do this, one assumes a statistical model of evolution (and often
tries to infer the best among a set of candidate models). Depending on
whether the trait of interest is discrete or continuous, the models are
typically discrete-space Markov chains (where the transition matrix is a
target of inference) or, in the continuous setting, either Brownian
Motion or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, where the former is used
for neutral evolution and the latter is used when there is hypothesized
selection on the trait.

The methodology used to fit models has followed the historical
progression from maximum parsimony models (a naive approach that favors
as few evolutionary changes as possible in discrete traits) to maximum
likelihood estimation. Modern methods revolve on using Bayesian methods,
which has the direct benefit of including uncertainty estimates in
infered ancestral states.

## Phylogenetic Transfer Learning

The core insight of Phylogenetic Transfer Learning (PTL) is to take the
the model of evolution and ancestral state infered via ASR, and simulate
the parameterized evolutionary model forward from the ancestral node to
get an estimate of extant trait values (with uncertainty) for species
without trait observations $T_i$.

The *transfer learning* component in particular comes from the first use
of this methods to inpute latent representations of species

# Substance of the paper

1.  Simulated phylogenies
    -   Various properties of radiation
2.  Real data

Relevant questions: - What phylogenetic scales can PTL give robust
predictions - There is a clear upper limit (if the MRCA for set of
species is too long ago, there will be massive variance in predicted
state at the tip) - There is also a lower limit (if there is HZT and the
phylogeny is not a reliable proxy for how traits are evolving) -
Robustness to noise is trait measurements? - How does this very w/
amount and different types of selection

# Possible Applications

-   SDMs: mechanistic niche predictions on subsets of species
-   Connectivity [@Catchen2023ImpEco]
